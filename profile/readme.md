# Hi! Welcome to docsforadobe! 👋

We're an independent community of artists & developers focused on Adobe Creative Cloud extensibility.

Scripting guides aside, our largest projects are:

* [types-for-adobe](https://github.com/docsforadobe/Types-for-Adobe), working towards complete type coverage of Creative Cloud applications across versions
* [aequery](https://github.com/docsforadobe/aequery), a jquery-like helper library for After Effects scripting.

Have questions, comments, or concerns? [Email us](hi@docsforadobe.dev)!
